	%Analysis 1.4
	For $f_1$ = 100 kHz, the computed $v_{out}$ is almost identical to the measured $v_2$ in lab using the 12" cable and very similar using the 180" cable. There is a 0.39 \% difference for the 12" cable and a 3.09\% difference for the 180" cable. On the other hand, $v_{out}$ is completely different from the measured $v_2$ in lab for $f_2$ = 100 MHz (Table 3, pg. 1).
	
	%Analysis 1.5
	\item As the ratio between the length of the cable and the wavelength in the circuit increases past 0.01, basic circuit analysis fails and we must use transmission line theory. If we do not, the phase delays of the signal and the interferences, constructive and destructive, on the line from the reflected wave become significant, causing otherwise unexpected measurements.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item I would expect that the output voltage of the RF signal source to be constant over the frequency range examined because the signal source was rated to be able to provide such a signal. However I did not observe and constant output voltage on channel 1 (Table 3, pg. 1). This is because there was a 24" BNC cable connecting the RF signal source to the oscilloscope. For the 100 MHz signal, this results in a 3.36 $l:\lambda$ ratio, so there is significant interference from the reflected wave and the line no longer acts as an ideal wire; it must be treated as a transmission line. 
	\item 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item An integrated circuit operating within 500 - 1000 MHz results in wavelengths between $0.3 - 0.6 m$, assuming $\varepsilon_r = 1$ (Eq. 1, pg. 1). If $\varepsilon_r = 1.9$, as in the lab, then the wavelengths will be between $0.212 - 0.435 m$. This means that lines of lengths of $3 - 6mm$ or $2.12 - 4.35mm$ must be treated as transmission lines. Since integrated circuit boards are often much larger than these ranges, an integrated circuit within 500 - 100 MHz needs to be treated as a transmission line system.
		\item Electrical lines in house operate at 50 or 60 Hz, depending on location. Following the same procedure as before, this results in wavelengths between $5000 - 6000 km$, assuming $\varepsilon_r = 1$, or $3627 - 4352 km$, if $\varepsilon_r = 1.9$ (Eq. 1, pg. 1). Houses, most of the time, do not contain nearly large enough dimensions to house cables of lengths from $36 - 60km$, so electrical lines running through a house does not need to be treated as a transmission line system.
		\item Using the same results as above, electrical lines connecting cities separated by hundreds of kilometers need to be treated as a transmission line system, because the length of the cables is larger than $36 - 60km$, with the same assumption that $\varepsilon_r = 1$ or $\varepsilon_r = 1.9$
		\item A VHF antenna from rabbit ear antenna to TV operates at frequencies between 30 - 300 MHz. This results in wavelengths between $1 - 10m$, assuming $\varepsilon_r = 1$. Likewise, wavelengths between $0.725 - 7.25m$ if the assumption is instead $\varepsilon_r = 1.9$ (Eq. 1, pg. 1). The cable connecting the antenna and TV is longer than $7 - 100mm$, so this needs to be treated as a transmission line system.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item A major assumption of a wire in DC analysis is that the signal travels instantly down the line. In fact, it is limited to the speed of light. Therefore, as the length of the line increases, the time delay from the moment the signal enters one end of a wire to the moment it reaches the other end of the wire increases. For a signal given by \emph{A}cos($\omega\emph{t}-\beta\emph{z}$), this time delay manifests itself as a phase shift of magnitude $\beta\emph{z}$.

\subsection{Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
	%Analysis 2.1
	\item Since the signal was 1 GHz and we are assuming $\varepsilon_r$ = 1, $\lambda$ = 300 $mm$ (Eq. 1, pg. 1). Then, the distance between the minima is 266 $mm$ - 116 $mm$ = 150 $mm$ or $\frac{\lambda}{2}$. This is equal to the theoretical value of $\frac{\lambda}{2}$.
	
	%Analysis 2.2
	\item The distance between the first minimum and maximum is 190 $mm$ - 116 $mm$ = 74 $mm$ or 0.247$\lambda$. This is very similar to the theoretical value of $\frac{\lambda}{4}$.
	
	%Analysis 2.3
	\item Plots are appended at the end of the document, pg. 5-7. The shorted load has a voltage minimum at the load, followed by a maximum $\frac{\lambda}{4}$ away from the load, followed by a minimum $\frac{\lambda}{2}$ away from the load, as expected. The open load has the exact opposite behavior, starting at a voltage maximum, then a minimum, then ending at a maximum. The matched load exhibits a constant voltage across the entire measured range, matching expected behavior. The resistive load starts at an intermediate value, first reaches a maximum, then a minimum. Furthermore, it the magnitude of the normalized voltage does not approach 1 because some power is absorbed in the load. For the capacitive load, it appears to have the same response as the open load, but this would be a coincidence. It should be a phase shifted version of the open or short circuit responses.

\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The standing wave pattern would have the same shape, but would have a phase shift.
	\item The voltage behavior is equivalent at multiples of $\frac{\lambda}{2}$ away from the load, so the reference does not have to be at the load. Furthermore, a short termination should have a voltage of 0 at the load, so we searched for an equivalent reference point along the line.

\subsection{Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
	%Analysis 3.1
	\item Calibrating the network analyzer allowed it to accurately measure the reflection coefficient for varying loads; the reflection coefficient was incorrectly measured when the network analyzer was uncalibrated. Calibration greatly lessened systematic error because the correct baseline upon which further measurements were made was correctly set through calibration. Random error, however, was unaffected by calibration.
	
	%Analysis 3.2
	\item Using Eq. 2 for the reflection coefficient and the fact that $Z_0$ = 50 $\Omega$,
	\begin{equation}
		\Gamma = \frac{Z_L-Z_0}{Z_l+Z_0}
	\end{equation}
	The theoretical values for $\Gamma$ are shown in Table 8. Furthermore, by converting our measured data from the network analyzer from the dB scale to the linear scale using Eq. 3,
	\begin{equation}
		\vert\Gamma\vert_{linear} = 10^{\mid\Gamma\mid_{dB}/20}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Load}     & $\vert\Gamma\vert_{linear}$ & $\vert\Gamma\vert_{theoretical}$ \\ \hline

		50 $\Omega$ (matched) & 1.00  	 &    0      \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Comparing linear reflection coefficient data with theoretical results}
		\label{}
	\end{table}	

	%Analysis 3.3
	\item The equation relating the standing wave ratio $S$ and the reflection coefficient $\Gamma$ is:
	\begin{equation} 
		S = \frac{1 + \vert\Gamma\vert}{1 - \vert\Gamma\vert}
	\end{equation}
	By solving Eq. 2 for $Z_L$, and using the fact that $\Gamma = \vert\Gamma\vert$ because $\Gamma$ can be assumed to be real,
	\begin{equation}
		Z_L = Z_0\frac{1 + \Gamma}{1 - \Gamma} = Z_0 S
	\end{equation}	 
	Finally, using Eq. 5 and the fact that $Z_0$ = 50 $\Omega$, it follows that $Z_L$ = 75.65 $\Omega$ at the frequency where the SWR minimum was measured, 170.5 MHz.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	%Question 3.1
	\item This antenna would not be good for broad-band communication systems between 20 Mhz - 2 GHz because the SWR is less than 2.5 only between 156.7 - 222.7 MHz from the Scanner Antenna SWR data. 
	
	%Question 3.2
	\item Since $Z_L$ = 75.65 $\Omega$ and using Eq. 4 and 5
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A 50 $\Omega$ transmission line system is what the antenna was tested with and results in $S$ = 1.513 at 170.5 MHz. Thus, the antenna works well with this system.
		\item A 75 $\Omega$ transmission line system is nearly matched and results in $S$ = 1.009 at 170.5 MHz. Thus, the antenna works well with this system.
		\item A 300 $\Omega$ transmission line system results in $S$ = 3.965. Thus, the antenna does not work well with this system.
